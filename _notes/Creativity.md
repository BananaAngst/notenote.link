Creativity: the capacity[^1] to solve problems.

Not to be confused with originality, which means creating something new, but not necessarily functional. Creativity needs guidelines, otherwise, it would be an artistic process.

## Tecniques / Mental models[^2] 
[[The Six Thinking Hats]]

[^1]: **Capacity**: having the necessary knowledge or ability to accomplish a task.
[^2]: In this case, tecniques is a mental model synonym because it implies looking at the problem from a different perspective.
