# Political Science
Politics, in its essence, encompasses activities meant to take decisions in groups and the distribution of power and resources. Political Science studies these behaviors. 

## Basic elements of an estate
An estate is a group of people operating under the same rights and laws. 
- The smallest part is the family, often called a tiny estate. More families constitute the people, and more people form an estate. 
- However, it's not complete without justice. As Aristotle put it: we were given a voice to speak up about what is right and wrong. There can be no association without justice, because it produces rights. Without rights and punishments, everyone could do what they desired and there would only be chaos. 

## Institutions
